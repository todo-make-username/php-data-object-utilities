		<p>Each tab contains a short description with examples and interactive demos of various attributes that are available to use from this library.</p>
		<p>When using these attributes, please use named arguments like in the examples. They are designed that way for our sanity. The exception being some of the tailor attributes which are wrappers for common PHP functions.</p>
